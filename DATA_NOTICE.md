# Important Notice About Data and Model Files

This repository contains only the source code for the Cassava Disease Detection project. Due to GitHub file size limitations, the following directories and files have been excluded:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation
- `models/`: Contains trained model weights
- `cassava_disease_example/`: Example images for testing
- `detect_example/`: Example detection outputs
- `pca_analysis_results/`: PCA analysis results
- `test_pipeline_result/`: Test pipeline outputs
- `yolo_v9s_heatmap_saliency_maps/`: YOLO heatmap visualizations

## Getting Started

To use this codebase, you will need to:

1. Obtain the model weights and place them in a `models/` directory
2. Prepare your data and place it in a suitable directory
3. Run the scripts as described in the README.md file
